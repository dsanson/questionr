`questionr` -- an R package for writing questions and quizzes using R markdown
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This package provides a convenient way to write self-graded quizzes using `R markdown`. This markup language easily allows the author to mix `R` code and graphics within HTML formatted text. The package makes it easy to integrate in questions.

Some samples are provided in the `inst` directory.


The package also has a web interface for the projects, though this is still
much a work in progress.
